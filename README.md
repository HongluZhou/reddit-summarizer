2019 spring NLP course project

### TODO notes
- 2019-04-17   
  - [x] Check Darpa dataset, downlownd and put them in one place. Identify which ones to use and evaluate the possibility of using and potential issues.
      - Darpa dataset and its schema have been uploaded in google folder. Use the Cyber one first. "selftext_m" key is for text, and "title_m" key is for title.    
  - [ ] Check other public Reddit dataset. 
  - [ ] Read tutorials.    
  - [ ] Read papers and tutorials regarding summarization task evaluation metrics.
